### Case System

There are four cases in IngGauche:

* Nominative (N)
    * Used to declare something as is or used for the subject of a sentence
* Objective (O)
    * Used for nouns that are arguments to a verb or are being acted upon by the verb
* Auxiliary (A)
    * Used for nouns that are not N O or G. E.g. In English:
        'I went with him to the store', 'him' and 'store' would be auxiliary since they are
        neither the subject nor the arguments for 'went'
* Genitive (G)
    * Used to show ownership

Declension system for cases:

| N | O | A | G |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | -(e)m | -(e)k | -(e)s |

Append these endings to the nominative form.
All nominative forms are English singular nouns
