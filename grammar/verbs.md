### Infinitives

Infinitives are borrowed wholly from English with only minor
adaptation. 

English -> IngGauche:

to X -> X

E.g. to be -> be

### Tenses

IngGauche has three tenses: Past, Present, Future
Classified as follows:
* Any aspect that takes place in present in English is present in IngGauche
* Any aspect that terminates before present in English is past in IngGauche
* Any aspect that begins after present in English is future in IngGauche

* Past: Simple Past, Past Progressive, Past Perfect, Present Perfect, Past Perfect Progressive
* Present: Simple Present, Present Progressive, Present Perfect Progressive
* Future: Simple Future, Future Progressive, Future Perfect, Future Perfect Progressive

### Present Tense Indicative Form

Start with the infinitive as the root and add endings according to person and number

Example verb chart: 

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 1s | 1p |
| 2s | 2p |
| 3s | 3p |

In English these symbols correspond to pronouns like so:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| I           | we |
| you         | you |
| he/she/it   | they | 

In IngGauche we would take the infinitive as the root. E.g. 'be-'
and then add the endings according to this chart:

Orthographic Representation

| | |
| --- | --- |
| -(e)f | -(e)v |
| -(e)s | -(e)s |
| -(e)th | -(e)th |

The e is fleeting, in that it only appears should the ending result
in an awkward consonant cluster.

E.g. "I bef" the e is not added since saying 'f' after a vowel is easy.
But saying "I giftef" required the 'ef' since 'ftf' is awkward in English

Pronunciation 

Endings are differentiated based by 1,2,3 person using different phonemes

Endings are differentiated by number by voicing or not voicing.

So first person singular is an unvoiced 'f' but first person plural is a voice 'v' (same sound)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| -(ə)f | -(ə)v |
| -(ə)s | -(ə)z |
| -(ə)θ | -(ə)ð |

Note:
* θ is the 'th' in 'think'
* ð is the 'th' in 'though'
* ə is the 'uh' in 'duh'

Examples: To be and to Have

English:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| I am      | we are |
| you   are      | you are |
| he/she/it is  | they are | 

IngGauche: 

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| I  bef         | we bev |
| you  bes       | you bes |
| he/she/it beth  | they beth | 

English:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| I have      | we have |
| you   have      | you have |
| he/she/it has  | they have | 

IngGauche: 

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| I  havef         | we havev |
| you  haves       | you haves |
| he/she/it haveth  | they haveth | 

### Future Tense Indicative Form

Future tense is formed simply by adding the 'ge' particle in front of the
present tense conjugation. Pronounced 'gə'

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| I  gehavef         | we gehavev |
| you  gehaves       | you gehaves |
| he/she/it gehaveth  | they gehaveth | 

The 'ge' is elided in favor of 'g' in cases where the verb begins with a vowel

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| I  gadvancef         | we gadvancev |
| you  gadvances       | you gadvances |
| he/she/it gadvanceth  | they gadvanceth | 

### Past Tense Indicative Form

The past tense is formed by adding '(e)d' or '(e)t' to the end of the present tense conjugation.
Depending on the voiced/voiceless ending

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| I  haveft         | we havevd |
| you  havest       | you havesd |
| he/she/it havetht  | they havethd | 

In the case above, the (e) is elided due to the root ending in a vowel.
In verbs with an awkward consonant cluster such as 'burn'

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| I  burnfet         | we burnved |
| you  burnset       | you burnsed |
| he/she/it burnthet  | they burnthed | 

### Verb Negation

Verbs are negated simply by prepending the particle 'ne' to a verb:

I negebeef -> I will not be
It neburnthet -> It didn't burn
