### Idea

Fun project as a first constructed language (conlang). This will basically be an auxiliary 
language to English, insofar that it uses English vocabulary in its entirety. What sets it
apart however are its new grammatical features borrowed/inspired from other languages.

#### Proposed Features

Case System: adding a real system for declining nouns in the nominative, objective, 
prepositional, and genitive cases.

Verb Conjugation: Reducing English to only three tenses that are communicated purely by 
inflection as opposed to using auxiliary verbs. And by regularizing the conjugation of all
verbs.

Agglutinative Prepositions: Making prepositions agglutinate to the noun they reference as
opposed to being separate particles. Perhaps agglutinate articles as well.

#### Moonshot Features

Gender System: Namely animate and inanimate.

Sentence Structure: No ideas at present.

### Aspirational Goal

Create a systematic grammar describing IngGauche and creating a translator that can process
rudimentary sentences into the new language.

### Name

IngGauche is a pun off the government system in George Orwell's *1984* and the word for 
left-handed/clumsy. Ideally IngGauche sounds like an obnoxious pidgin to the prescriptive ear.
